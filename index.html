          1. The Most Populous Nation in Africa: Nigeria is the most populous black
          nation on Earth, and it's also the most populous country in Africa,
          with over 200 million inhabitants. This means roughly one in every
          seven Africans is Nigerian!
        </p>
        <p> 
          2. Home to Nollywood, the World's Second-Largest Film Industry: Nigeria's film industry, affectionately
          known as "Nollywood," is incredibly prolific. It produces thousands of
          movies each year, making it the second-largest film industry in the
          world in terms of output, just behind India's Bollywood. These films
          are widely popular across Africa and among the diaspora. 
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A Linguistic Wonderland: Nigeria is one of the most linguistically diverse
          countries globally, with over 500 indigenous languages spoken across
          its many ethnic groups. While English is the official language, major
          indigenous languages include Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba. 
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Largest Economy in Africa: Nigeria boasts the largest economy on the African
          continent. It is a major producer of oil and gas and is projected to
          rank among the world's top ten economies by 2050. 
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Rich in Biodiversity, Including Butterflies: Nigeria has exceptional
          biodiversity, with an abundance of flora and fauna. It's particularly
          famous for its beautiful and diverse butterflies, with over 1000
          documented species, and new ones still being discovered!
